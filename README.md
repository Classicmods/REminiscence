REminiscence libretro
=====================

Port of Gregory Montoir's Flashback emulator, running as a libretro core.

## Info

This port is still a work in progress, however it is in a working state. 
Currently, it jumps directly into the game, skipping the main menu.

## Running

* PC game data files
* Amiga .mod files (for music)
* VOICE.VCE for in-game dialog (optional)
